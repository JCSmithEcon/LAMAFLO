Labour market flows: labour market dynamics constructed from UKHLS/BHPS work-life history data files

This repository holds code and documents related to my Understanding Society Event Histories Fellowship (2022-23). The code updates the 2020 work of Liam Wright to provide full histories of individuals’ labour market histories using BHPS and UKHLS data. The code also calculates measures of labour market dynamics at individual level and over time. The code creates datasets providing information on labour market status as well as dynamic measures: labour market flows, transition rates, and spell durations, as well as simple metrics such as counts of particular transitions and spell types between interviews, and ‘aggregate’ flows and flow rates.

UKHLS and BHPS data are an under-utilised source of information on labour market dynamics. I hope that research, data and policy communities will benefit from greater provision of resources for and analysis of this additional excellent source of information. The ability in the UKHLS/BHPS to analyse labour market dynamics alongside very rich other data will enable research that is not possible using other sources.

Anyone creating labour market histories from BHPS and UKHLS data is standing on the shoulders of giants. Great credit is due to those who have worked on these data before, including Gillian Paull, Brendan Halpin, David Maré and particularly Liam Wright for his immense and well-documented efforts, available in GitHub at https://github.com/ljwright/work-life-histories-ukhls-bhps and in OSF at https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/C3V9F.

Some of the code provided here is new. Most code files are modified versions of Liam Wright's code. To create labour market histories, these new or changed files need to be supplemented with some unchanged files created by Liam Wright, which are also provided here.
